# 🏝️ Noori's Travels – Travel Destination Explorer

✈️ Welcome aboard! This is my **Web Engineering assignment project** where I built a responsive travel website using **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap (via CDN)**.  

Think of it as your ticket to explore destinations, browse travel packages, and maybe even book your next adventure (if only it were real 😉).
